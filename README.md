# smaRsi_strat
This code implements a trading strategy that combines the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and two Moving Averages (MA) to identify buy and sell signals for a given stock. It then optimizes the parameters of this strategy to maximize profit. However, it has major theoretical problems such as overfitting and doesn't take a lot of things into consideration, such as transaction costs and slippage. This was just a fun project for me to get myself into algorithmic trading and backtesting. 

Change the increments on the ranges to get a more 'optimal' set of parameters.
Use the multipleScripts.py to split into separate scripts so you could run the code in sections simultaneously, taking advantage of your cpu's cores.
