# smaRsi_strat
This code implements a trading strategy that combines the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and two Moving Averages (MA) to identify buy and sell signals for a given stock. It then optimizes the parameters of this strategy to maximize profit. However, it has major theoretical problems such as overfitting and doesn't take a lot of things into consideration, such as transaction costs and slippage. This was just a fun project for me to get myself into algorithmic trading and backtesting.
